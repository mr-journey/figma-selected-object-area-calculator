# Figma Selected Object Area Calculator

A Figma plugin that accurately calculates the geometric area of selected objects, including complex vector shapes with bezier curves.

## Features

üîç **Accurate Area Calculation**

- Vector shapes with complex bezier curves (adaptive sampling)
- Ellipses using mathematical formula (œÄ √ó radiusX √ó radiusY)
- Rectangles and polygons using actual geometry
- Real-time updates during transformations

üìä **Smart Display**

- Total area in square pixels for all selected objects combined
- Percentage comparison against a stored reference area
- Live updates as you resize or transform objects
- Clean, modern UI

‚ö° **Performance Optimized**

- Efficient polling system
- Only updates when area actually changes
- Graceful fallback for unsupported shapes

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the plugin:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. In Figma, go to **Plugins** ‚Üí **Development** ‚Üí **Import plugin from manifest**
5. Select the `manifest.json` file from the project directory

## Usage

1. **Launch the plugin**: Go to **Plugins** ‚Üí **Development** ‚Üí **Figma Selected Object Area Calculator**
2. **Select objects**: Click on any object or multiple objects in your Figma canvas
3. **Store reference area**: Click the store button to save the current selection's area as a reference
4. **Compare areas**: Select different objects to see:
   - **Total area**: Combined area of currently selected objects in square pixels
   - **Percentage**: How the current selection compares to your stored reference area
   - **Real-time updates**: Values update live as you modify selections

### How the Percentage Comparison Works

The percentage feature lets you compare areas relative to a stored reference:

1. **Store a reference**: Select an object (or multiple objects) and store its area
2. **Compare**: Select any other object(s) to see the percentage comparison

```
Percentage = (Current Selection Area √∑ Stored Reference Area) √ó 100
```

**Example workflow:**

- Select a logo ‚Üí Store area (reference: 10,000 pixels)
- Select an icon ‚Üí Shows **25%** (icon is 2,500 pixels, 25% of logo size)
- Select a button ‚Üí Shows **150%** (button is 15,000 pixels, 150% of logo size)

This is perfect for maintaining consistent sizing relationships across design elements.

### Supported Object Types

| Object Type   | Calculation Method                                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vector**    | Parses SVG path data with adaptive bezier curve sampling |
| **Ellipse**   | Mathematical formula: œÄ √ó radiusX √ó radiusY              |
| **Rectangle** | Width √ó height                                           |
| **Polygon**   | Shoelace formula on actual geometry points               |
| **Star**      | Parses geometry for accurate star shape area             |
| **Other**     | Bounding box fallback (width √ó height)                   |

## Development

### Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build the plugin for production
- `npm run watch` - Watch for changes and rebuild automatically

### Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code.ts      # Main plugin logic (runs in Figma)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui.tsx       # React UI component
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types.d.ts   # TypeScript declarations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/            # Built files (created by build process)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build.js         # Build script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json    # Figma plugin manifest
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json     # Dependencies and scripts
```

### Technical Details

**Advanced Geometry Calculation:**

- **Bezier Curve Sampling**: Adaptively samples curves based on length for accuracy
- **Shoelace Formula**: Calculates polygon area from coordinate points
- **Path Data Parsing**: Handles SVG path commands (M, L, C, Q, Z)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to bounding box when geometry parsing fails

**TypeScript Support:**

- Full type safety with `@figma/plugin-typings`
- CDN React types for UI components
- Zero TypeScript errors

## Examples

### Simple Shapes

- **Rectangle 100√ó50px**: 5,000 square pixels
- **Circle 100px diameter**: ~7,854 square pixels
- **Complex vector logo**: Accurate area based on actual filled geometry

### Multiple Selection & Area Comparison

Select multiple objects to see their **combined total area** - perfect for:

- **Design system consistency**: Store a primary element's area, then compare other elements
- **Proportional sizing**: Ensure icons are 50% of button size, headers are 200% of body text, etc.
- **Layout balance**: Compare section areas to maintain visual hierarchy
- **Quality control**: Verify similar elements have consistent areas across your design

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin not loading?**

- Make sure you've run `npm install` and `npm run build`
- Check that `manifest.json` exists in the project root

**Area calculation seems wrong?**

- The plugin calculates filled area, not bounding box area
- For complex vectors, it uses adaptive sampling which is highly accurate
- Text objects use bounding box area (actual text rendering area varies by font)

**Performance issues?**

- The plugin polls every 200ms when objects are selected
- This provides smooth real-time updates during transformations
- Polling automatically stops when nothing is selected
